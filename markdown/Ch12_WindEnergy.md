# Wind Energy

Wind energy has made significant inroads for electricity production in the U.S. and globally. Today, the U.S. gets about 2.5% of its energy (and 6.5% of electricity) from wind. Globally, wind accounts for about 2.6% of energy, or 4.8% of electrical production (Table [7.2; p.107\)](#page-126-0).

The basic technology of harnessing wind power is rather old, powering ships, milling operations, and water pumps for centuries. Today, the predominant use of wind drives [generators](#page-448-0) to make electricity.

Just as hydroelectric power is related to the very basic form of [grav](#page-448-1)[itational potential energy,](#page-448-1) wind is connected to another simple and easy-to-understand form: [kinetic energy.](#page-450-0) This chapter first develops familiarity with kinetic energy, then explores how we get energy from wind, how much we get, and future prospects.

An object in motion carries [kinetic energy](#page-450-0) equal to one-half its mass times the velocity squared.

**Definition 12.1.1** *The [kinetic energy](#page-450-0) of a mass,* 푚*, moving at velocity,* 푣*, is* 1

$$
K.E. = \frac{1}{2}mv^2.
$$
 (12.1)

**Example 12.1.1** A 70 kg person walking at a brisk 2 m/s would have a kinetic energy of 140 J.  

For examples like these, framed as state-Pushing a 50 kg ice skater from rest at a power of 75 W for 3 seconds would impart 225 J of kinetic energy, resulting in a speed of 3 m/s.

Often, we use energy sources to *deliver* kinetic energy, as in moving planes, trains and automobiles.

**Example 12.1.2** A 1,500 kg car moving at freeway speeds (30 m/s) has a kinetic energy around 675 kJ.

Getting up to this speed from rest in 5 seconds would require a power of 135 kW,<sup>1</sup> equating to 180 horsepower.<sup>2</sup>

acceleration. But we can also go the other direction and convert kinetic energy into different forms of energy<sup>3</sup> for versatile use. Most commonly, we turn 3: See [Table](#page-89-0) [5.2](#page-89-0) (p. [70\)](#page-89-0), for examples. kinetic energy into electrical potential energy (a voltage) that can drive a circuit. At this point, the energy can be used to toast a bagel, charge a phone, or wash clothes.

The method for converting kinetic energy into electricity is usually accomplished by transferring kinetic energy in a moving fluid<sup>4</sup> into rotation of a shaft by way of a [turbine—](#page-457-0)essentially fan blades. The spinning shaft then turns an electric [generator,](#page-448-0) which consists of the relative motion between magnets and coils of wire, and is essentially the same construction/concept as an electric motor run in reverse.

Hydroelectric installations do the same thing—turning a shaft via blades of a turbine—even though we framed the energy source as one of gravitational potential energy. Within the dam's turbine, the water acquires kinetic energy as it flows from the reservoir to the outlet. Wind energy acts in much the same way, converting kinetic energy in the moving air into rotational motion of a fan/turbine whose shaft is connected to a generator located behind the blades.

# <span id="page-204-0"></span>**12.2 Wind Energy**

It is tempting to think of air as "empty" space, but at sea level air has a density of 1.25 kg per cubic meter (휌air <sup>≈</sup> <sup>1</sup>.25 kg/m<sup>3</sup> ). Let this sink in visually: imagine a cubic meter sitting next to you (as in [Figure](#page-204-1) [12.1\)](#page-204-1). The air within has a mass of 1.25 kg (about 2.75 lb). Now draw a square meter on the ground—either literally or in your imagination. The many kilometers of air extending vertically over the top of that square meter has a mass of ∼10,000 kg! For context, figure out how many cars that would be (typ. 1,500 kg ea.), or what kind of animal would be this massive.

What this means is that air in motion can carry a significant amount of [kinetic energy,](#page-450-0) since neither its mass nor velocity are zero. If the entire earth's atmosphere moved at 5 m/s—a noticeable breeze—at a total mass<sup>5</sup> of  $5 \times 10^{18}$  kg, we'd have  $6 \times 10^{19}$  J of kinetic energy in air currents. If we somehow pulled all this energy out of the air—stopping its motion entirely—we might expect the atmosphere to revive its normal wind<span id="page-204-1"></span>![](../figures/Ch12_WindEnergy/_page_204_Figure_18.jpeg)

**Figure 12.1:** The mass of a cubic meter of air is 1.25 kg, and the mass of atmosphere over one square meter is an astounding 10 metric tons.

patterns over the course of 24 hours: a full day of the driving solar input around the globe. The associated power works out to 700 TW. Notice that the value for wind in Table [10.2](#page-187-0) [\(p.168\)](#page-187-0) is pretty-darned close to this, at 900 TW.<sup>6</sup> As the margin note indicates, we should be pleased to get within a factor of two for so little work and very off-the-cuff assumptions about global average air speed (see [Box](#page-205-0) [12.1](#page-205-0) for related thoughts). [Figure](#page-205-1) [12.2](#page-205-1) shows the annual average wind velocity at a height of 80 m (typical wind turbine height) for the U.S. Note that the 5 m/s we used above falls comfortably within the 4–8 m/s range seen in the map.

#### See if you can confirm; own it yourself!

6: In the first draft of this textbook, a different data source was used for [Table](#page-187-0) [10.2](#page-187-0) that had wind at 370 TW. Even so, the 700 TW estimate corroborated the orderof-magnitude scale and was deemed a satisfactory check: within a factor of two.

**Figure 12.2:** Average wind velocity at a height of 80 m across the U.S. [\[69\]](#page-435-0). Boundaries between colored boxes are every 0.5 m/s from 4.0 m/s to 10.0 m/s.

Calculations like the one above offer a way to see if something at least checks out and seems plausible. If we had found that the whole atmosphere would have to be moving at 50 m/s to get the 900 TW figure in Table [10.2](#page-187-0) [\(p. 168\),](#page-187-0) we would suspect a problem, and either distrust the 900 TW number—seeking another source to confirm—or re-evaluate our own understanding. If we could get to 900 TW by only having wind speeds of 0.1 m/s,<sup>7</sup> we would also have cause for skepticism. When crude estimates of this type land in the general vicinity<sup>8</sup> of a number we see in a table, we can at least be assured that the number is not outlandish, and that our basic understanding of the phenomenon is okay. Checking understanding against presented data is excellent practice!

### <span id="page-206-0"></span>**12.2.1 Wind Turbines**

To understand practically-available energy, we back up and consider how much air hits a wind turbine whose rotor diameter is 푅. [Figure](#page-206-1) [12.3](#page-206-1) illustrates the concept. If the wind speed is 푣, the air travels a distance 푣Δ푡 in time interval <sup>Δ</sup>푡. 9

<span id="page-206-1"></span>![](../figures/Ch12_WindEnergy/_page_206_Figure_4.jpeg)

The cross-sectional area of the wind turbine (rotor) is defined as the area swept out by the blades, so  $\pi R^2$ . Thus the volume of the cylinder of air interacting with the turbine over time interval  $\Delta t$  is the "base" (circular) area of the cylinder times its "height" (straight length,  $v\Delta t$ ), or  $V = \pi R^2v\Delta t$ . We know the density of the air,[<sup>10</sup>](#page-453-0) so the mass of the cylinder is  $m = \rho_{air}V = \rho_{air}\pi R^2v\Delta t$ . The kinetic energy *contained* in this cylinder of air is therefore K.E.  $= \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}\rho_{air}\pi R^2v^3\Delta t$ . Now let's get rid of that pesky  $\Delta t$ . Think for a moment what happens if we divide both sides by  $\Delta t$ : it will definitely get rid of the  $\Delta t$  on the right-hand-side, but what does the left-hand side mean: energy over time? Hopefully, this is familiar by now as the concept of [power.](#page-453-0)

Efficiency has been inserted as*  $\epsilon$  *and tends to be 40–50% for modern turbines.*Notice that the delivered power scales, sensibly, with the area of the wind turbine's blade path, but more importantly and perhaps surprisingly as the velocity *cubed* [\(Table](#page-206-2) [12.1\)](#page-206-2).

up straight: that's a very strong function of velocity! It means that if the wind changes from a gentle 5 m/s to a brisk 10 m/s, the power available goes up by a factor of 8. A strong wind at 20 m/s has 64 times as much power as the 5 m/s breeze.<sup>11</sup> 11: Now it may be easier to understand why We can understand the three powers of velocity thusly: two powers come from kinetic energy, and one from the length of the cylinder. As wind speed increases, not only does the oncoming air have more kinetic energy per fixed volume, but also a larger volume encounters the turbine in a given time.

Setting  $\varepsilon$  = 1 in [Eq.](#page-206-3) [12.2](#page-206-3) corresponds to the *total* power present in the wind. But we can't be greedy and grab *all* of it. In fact, if we did, it would mean *stopping* the air at the wind turbine: pulling out all the kinetic energy means no velocity is left. If we did this, newly arriving air would divert around the stopped mass of air, and the turbine would no longer have access to oncoming energy. The theory has all been worked out:<sup>12</sup> a turbine is limited to  $\varepsilon \le 16/27$  (59%) of the available energy, known as the [Betz limit](#page-442-0) [\[72\]](#page-435-3). This is not a technological limitation, but comes from the physics of fluid flow. A second consideration enters for low-speed rotor motion, known as the Glauert limit [\[73\]](#page-435-4), resulting in diminishing efficiency as wind speed drops.

[Figure](#page-207-0) [12.4](#page-207-0) shows these theoretical limits, along with design limits from various rotor configurations. Curves reflect an optimum rotor speed for each design: speeding up produces more generator output until it gets fast enough that air drag on the blades starts to dominate. The most common modern turbine is the 3-blade design,<sup>[13](#page-207-0)</sup> able to get roughly 50% of the energy out of the wind. Notice that the tip speed can be quite high: 6–8 times the wind speed. This can be quite alarming to birds in the area, whose cruising speed is nearer wind speed, and they

For a modern derivation of the [Betz limit](#page-442-0) and how efficiency depends on tip speed, see [\[71\]](#page-435-2) [\[71\]](#page-435-2): Ragheb et al. (2011), "Wind Turbines . The largest turbines—having 150 m diameter rotors—are rated for up to 10 MW of electrical power production.

**Example 12.2.1** How much power could you expect a small (4 m *diameter*) 3-blade wind turbine situated atop your house to deliver in a respectable 5 m/s breeze?The radius is 2 m and we'll pick a middle-of-the-road efficiency of 45%:  $P = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.45 \cdot (1.25 \text{ kg/m}^3) \cdot \pi \cdot (2 \text{ m})^2 \cdot (5 \text{ m/s})^3$  comes to about 450 W.[<sup>14</sup>](#page-21-1)
[14](#page-21-1): Not too impressive: hard to get muchBesides the limit on how much power can be pulled out of the air by a single turbine, we also find limits on how *densely* they may be populated in a given area: how much space is required between turbines so that one does not disrupt the other. Obviously, it would not serve to put one turbine directly behind another, as they would at best split the available power arriving as wind. Even side by side, it is best to leave room between windmills so that additional rows are not deprived of wind power. A rule of thumb is to separate turbines by at least 5–8 diameters side-to-side, and 7–15 diameters<sup>[15](#cite_note-15)</sup> along the (prevailing) wind direction. For the sake of illustration, [Figure](#page-208-0) [12.5](#page-208-0) shows a spacing on the denser side of the range, but otherwise we adopt the more recent recommendations and use 8 diameters side-to-side and 15 diameters deep [\[75\]](#page-435-6). This works out to a 0.65% ["fill factor,](#page-447-0)" meaning that 0.65% of the land area contains an associated rotor cross section.<sup>[16](#cite_note-16)</sup>
15: An older "rule of thumb" was 5 side-to-side and 7-8 deep, but newer work suggests as much as 8 diameters side-to-side and 15 diameters deep.

<span id="page-208-0"></span>![](../figures/Ch12_WindEnergy/_page_208_Figure_5.jpeg)

In order to compare to other forms of renewable energy, we can evaluate a power per unit land area (in W/m<sup>2</sup> ) by the following approach:

$$
\frac{\text{power}}{\text{area}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon\rho_{\text{air}}\pi R^{2} v^{3}}{480R^{2}} = \frac{\pi}{960}\varepsilon\rho_{\text{air}}v^{3}, \quad (12.3)

wind is not always blowing, and its speed varies over wide ranges. In this sense, wind is an *intermittent* power source. Just as for hydroelectric installations, wind resources are characterized by a regionally-dependent [capacity factor,](#page-443-0) which is the ratio of energy delivered to what would have been delivered if the generation facility operated at full capacity at all times. Typical capacity factors for wind in the U.S.<sup>18</sup> 18: [Capacity factors](#page-443-0) for wind are smaller are around 33%, and [Figure](#page-209-0) [12.6](#page-209-0) provides a visual sense for how this manifests in the real world: pretty erratic.

<span id="page-209-0"></span>![](../figures/Ch12_WindEnergy/_page_209_Figure_2.jpeg)

For very low wind speeds,[<sup>19</sup>](#page-448-0) wind turbines do not have enough wind to turn at all and sit still at zero output. Furthermore, a turbine is rated at some maximum power output, which occurs at some moderately high wind speed,[<sup>20</sup>](#page-448-0) beyond which the [generator](#page-448-0) risks damage—like "redlining" a car's engine. When the wind climbs above this maximum-rated speed, the turbine is pegged at its maximum power—no longer following a  $v^3$  relation—and deliberately twists its blades[<sup>21</sup>](#page-448-0) to be *less* efficient as the wind speed grows so that it maintains constant (maximum) power output. When the wind speed becomes large enough to endanger the [turbine,](#page-457-0) it will twist its blades parallel to the wind to allow the air to pass without turning the rotor at all, so that it no longer spins while it "rides out" the high winds.[<sup>22</sup>](#page-448-0)

Global wind installations are rising rapidly, currently (as of 2020) above 600 GW of installed capacity.<sup>23</sup> [Table](#page-210-1) [12.2](#page-210-1) lists the major players, in to the [capacity factor.](#page-443-0) terms of installed capacity, average generation, fraction of total energy,<sup>24</sup> capacity factor, and share of global wind generation.

In 2018, the U.S. had about 94 GW of *installed* wind capability.<sup>25</sup> This 25: From tables 1.14.B and 6.2.B in [\[85\]](#page-436-1) number has recently surpassed hydroelectric installed capacity (about 80 GW). Both are impacted by [capacity factors,](#page-443-0) which for wind averages 33% in the U.S., while hydropower is just over 40%. The net effect is that the generation for the two is pretty comparable.<sup>26</sup> Where is the wind 26: . . . as we also saw in Table [10.3](#page-189-0) [\(p.170\)](#page-189-0) power in the U.S. installed? [Figure](#page-210-2) [12.8](#page-210-2) shows that Texas wins, at 8.7 GW. Oklahoma is a distant second at 3.2 GW, Iowa at 2.5 GW. California is in fifth place at 1.6 GW.

**Figure 12.8:** Wind power by state, in terms of average generation, in GW, in 2018. The color scale may seem unhelpful, but the unavoidable truth is that many states don't have a lot going on, and Texas is so dominant as to render other states almost insignificant. A logarithmic color scale could help, but then the important lesson on the gross disparity might go unappreciated.

Following the flow we used in Sec. [11.3](#page-197-0) [\(p.178\),](#page-197-0) we show wind generation as a function of area [\(Figure](#page-211-0) [12.9\)](#page-211-0), to get a sense for how concentrated the installations are. Oklahoma and Iowa jump in front of Texas by this measure. Texas has more total generation than all others, but is a very large state in terms of area. Iowa, for instance produces about 30% as much wind power as Texas, but at only 20% the size. The numbers, reaching about 0.017 W/m<sup>2</sup> are a bit smaller than those for hydroelectricity, where two states exceeded this value.<sup>27</sup> We can compare these numbers to the 0.2 W/m<sup>2</sup> *fully-developed* potential we estimated in the paragraph following [Eq.](#page-208-1) [12.3](#page-208-1) to conclude that in principle we could expand wind by a large factor.<sup>28</sup>

Next, we look at wind generation per capita in states, in [Figure](#page-211-1) [12.10.](#page-211-1) Now North Dakota blows away the rest, at 1.6 kW per person, followed by four states at about half of this value. We can put this in context by noting that the average power consumption in the U.S. per capita is around 10 kW.

Finally, [Figure](#page-212-1) [12.11](#page-212-1) shows wind capacity factors, indicating where the wind is most reliable. It peaks around 41% in Kansas, but all of the plains states in general do well. The southeastern U.S. has almost no wind development,<sup>29</sup> 29: Lack of wind makes it a poor fit: see as is evident in any one of these figures.

## <span id="page-212-0"></span>**12.4 Upshot: Wind is not Overblown**

Wind has surged tremendously in the last decade (Fig. [7.5; p.108\)](#page-127-0), proving to be an economically viable and competitive resource. But how much could we expect to get from wind?

Putting a few of the previous results together, If the entire contiguous U.S. (area ∼10<sup>13</sup> m<sup>2</sup>) were developed for wind at an estimated power density of 0.2 W/m2—which was based on a 5 m/s average wind speed—and a capacity factor of 33%, the U.S. could theoretically produce 0.7 TW<sup>30</sup>[\[30\]](#page-10-1) from wind—roughly 20 times what is produced today. We should take this crude estimate as an extreme upper end, since it is inconceivable that we would develop wind so fully as to never be more than a few hundred meters—a few rotor diameters—away from a wind turbine, no matter where we go. Also, many areas are sub-threshold and would not support investment in wind development. 30: We're fudging things a bit here forEven so, the inflated 0.7 TW estimate falls short of the current 3.3 TW energy demand in the U.S., has major intermittency problems, and is not in a form that can be well-used in all [sectors,](#page-455-0) like transportation and industrial processing. While wind *alone* cannot replace fossil fuels at the current level of demand, it *can* doubtless be a significant contributor.

Globally, estimates for wind potential tend to be in the few-terawatt range, though can be as low as 1 TW for a number of practical reasons. As was the case for hydroelectricity, wind is a viable player in the renewables mix, but is unable to shoulder the entire load. [\[70\]](#page-435-1): Castro et al. (2011), “Global WindWind energy is not free of environmental concerns, disturbing landscapes and habitats. Its impact on birds<sup>31</sup> 31: Domestic cats turn out to kill far more and bats is most worrisome, as the rotors move far faster than anything to which the wildlife is habituated. Still, compared to the environmental toll from fossil fuels, it is fairly clean—similar to the impact of hydroelectric power.

A pros and cons list will help summarize. First, the positive attributes:

I Wind is replenished on the planet daily by solar illumination;

the sake of simplicity. If turbines are built for 12 m/s, the capacity factor already has some averaging built in, so using 5 m/s *and* a capacity factor of 0.33 is unfair. On the other hand, much of the country spends substantial time below the cut-in speed for turbines, and the cruel cubic function of velocity greatly suppresses much of the land area as impractical for wind development. So the approach is a compromise that might balance out reasonably.

birds than wind turbines do, currently.

- I Harnessing wind is relatively low-tech and straightforward;
- I Wind has decent efficiency—typically 40–50%—in extracting energy from the oncoming wind;
- I Life-cycle CO<sup>2</sup> [emissions](#page-451-0) for wind is only 2% that of traditional fossil fuel electricity [\[68\]](#page-435-10) [\[68\]](#page-435-10): (2020), *Life Cycle GHG Emissions* ;
- I Growth in the wind sector points to economic viability;
- I Wind is able to scale up to cover a meaningful fraction of energy demand.

And the downsides:

- I Wind is intermittent: power when nature allows, not when people demand;
- I Wind is regionally variable: many places do not produce enough wind to support development;
- I Wind can cause environmental disruption to habitats—especially dangerous to birds and bats;
- I Esthetic objections to noise and degradation of scenery hamper expansion.

Atmospheric pressure is about 10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup> , meaning that a 100,000 N weight of air—corresponding to a mass of 10,000 kg—sits atop very square meter of the ground (at or near sea level). If the air density were constant at 1.25 kg/m3—rather than decreasing with height as it actually does—how high would the atmosphere extend to result in this weight (mass)?

Reflect on the fact that just estimating the rotor blade length and timing its revolution is enough for you to produce an estimate of power being generated!

What is the ratio of power values you read off the plot, and how does this compare to theoretical expectations for the ratio going like the cube of velocity?
