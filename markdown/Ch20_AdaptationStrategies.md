# Adaptation Strategies

We made it to the final chapter. How are we doing? Anxious? Excited? Alarmed? Inspired? This book has compressed a perspective that took the author many years to absorb. Exposure in one short sprint would likely be overwhelming, and might even generate an impulse to reject the message as both unfamiliar and grim—thus hopefully wrong?

Up to this point, the theme of the book might be characterized as one of closing lots of exits. Growth can't continue indefinitely—requiring a whole different economic model. Space is not a realistic escape hatch. Fossil fuels are what made this life possible, but will not last and are causing disruptive climate change. The alternative options all have their own practical limitations, and offer no drop-in replacements for fossil fuels. At least sunshine offers a ray of light as a super-abundant energy flow. But when it comes to making collectively smart decisions about a future path, more obstacles surface on the human side. Success requires long-term planning and not the more common crisis response.

This chapter changes gears a bit to touch on individual actions and values that could amount to big things in aggregate. At the very least, it may provide individual-scale escape hatches allowing some peace of mind about personal contributions to the problem.

How many people do you know who are concerned about a legitimate threat of collapse of our civilization? It is an extreme outcome, and one without modern precedent. It seems like a fringe, alarmist position that is uncomfortable to even talk about in respectable company. Yet the evidence on the ground points to many real concerns:

- 1. The earth has never had to accommodate 8 billion people at this level of resource demand;
- 2. Humankind has never run out of a resource as vital as fossil fuels;
- 3. Humans have never until now altered the atmosphere to the point of changing the planet's thermal equilibrium;
- 4. We have never before witnessed species extinction at this rate, or seen such dramatic changes to wild spaces and to the ocean.

Just because something big has not happened yet does not constitute strong evidence that it cannot or will not. But more important than that argument—which is always true—is the number of credible causes for concern that are evident today.

Also important to recognize is that a challenge cannot be effectively mitigated unless it is first identified and acknowledged. The very lack of collective awareness about a credible risk of collapse is *itself* unsettling. If open discussion of the possibility of collapse were not so uncomfortable and off-putting, we would stand a better chance of preventing its unfolding. It would be a huge relief to be wrong about the concern. But not taking it seriously represents a colossal risk.

#### **Box 20.1: The Y2K Scare**

The Y2K<sup>[1](#page-3-1)</sup> scare in 1999 offers a good template for how to mitigate a potential disaster. Computer systems became the dominant means for managing financial and government records, transactions, and accounts in the 1960s through 1980s. A two-digit code was used for the year in many records, not anticipating the roll-over to 2000 decades away. The early programmers either doubted that their code would still be functioning in 2000<sup>[2](#page-3-2)</sup> or assumed it would be cleaned up in time. In the year or two leading up to Y2K, the issue got tons of coverage and predictions of mayhem, as peoples' digital lives—a new phenomenon—were tossed into any number of unknown upheavals. But the very fact that the issue dominated public consciousness was exactly what ensured a smooth transition. Every bank and agency got on the job and Y2K came and went without a ripple. It would be great to see a repeat in the case of potential collapse. The lack of a specific time prediction is one barrier, unlike Y2K. Without a firm deadline or a clear-and-present danger, the temptation to delay serious attention is strong.  
  

<sup>1</sup>: Y2K is short for year-2000.  

<sup>2</sup>: Surprise—it was!A key contributor to awareness is in how information sources and activities shape opinions and views. A world overflowing with information can be difficult to navigate, and has a tendency to coagulate into isolated domains that cater to predispositions. The result can be disagreement on basic facts, making coordinated progress difficult. Luckily, attentive individuals can perform an assessment of the trustworthiness of various information outlets. The process is to watch an entire live event, like a

debate or a hearing, and see how the event is covered by various news sources. Does the coverage<sup>3</sup> reflect the event as you experienced it? Did it focus on the key developments or on distractions that might be emotionally "triggering?"

Entertainment is another source/activity that can influence mindsets in subtle ways. For example, the grossly simplified and virtual world of video games promotes a false sense of what is possible—rather than helping model responses to real-world challenges, constrained by many layers of practical considerations. Reaching level 42 without suffering too many damage points is a fairly empty accomplishment<sup>4</sup> that just means having followed some game designer's artificial and arbitrary rule set pretty well, combined with some skill in pressing buttons. More impressive is building or creating something, repairing something, or having some beneficial impact in the external world that would not otherwise have happened.

Likewise for movies and shows, which can provide healthy joy and social bonding. But because the industry is not constrained to follow rules of nature, it is easy to form dangerous misconceptions about what humans are capable of doing.<sup>5</sup> As a result, not only does the likelihood of disappointment increase, but the necessary sort of deliberate and unglamorous work that must be initiated well before crisis becomes apparent is less likely to materialize if the populace is trained to hold out for unrealistic and spectacularly successful outcomes.<sup>6</sup> 6: . . . jet packs, flying cars, fusion power,

### <span id="page-349-0"></span>**20.2 Communication**

In a democracy, collective public awareness drives the issues politicians serve. Only by having voters demand action will progress follow. Conversations with friends and family then become necessary to raise awareness among others. Effective communication that accomplishes this goal without turning people off is tricky. When the message contains bad news or suggests sacrifice, the effort can easily backfire.

It is important not to polarize the conversation by "bossing" people or projecting a sense of authority. An effective strategy is to fairly represent uncertainty, while still conveying credible concern. Caveats like "it seems that," or "it appears to me that," or "I may be wrong, but" go a long way to taking the edge off of the message and inviting the listener into a constructive conversation. It is possible to couch the language in uncertainty while still hitting the main points. Words like "possible," "likely," "plausible," and "risk" can be useful to soften the tone but still express concern.

Division in the U.S. is frighteningly high right now, so that distrust is a real barrier to sharing a common factual basis. The communication needs to be "we," not "you." For instance, "we really should be concerned 3: Boring coverage turns out to be a decent indicator of accuracy!

about X" rather than "I think you should X." It is best to try to convey a sense that we are all in this together. Expressions like "I worry that," or "Do you also feel that. . . " bring a human touch and invite a sense of inclusion and collaboration.

One potentially interesting approach is to appeal to the fundamentally conservative nature of most people. This is conservative with a small "c," rather than the Conservative (right-leaning) political party. In this sense, conservative means:

- 1. low risk: let's not gamble the future on speculative notions;
- 2. conservation<sup>7</sup> of resources and quality of the earth environment; 7: It's right there in the name!
- 3. laying the groundwork for future generations (e.g., grandchildren) to have a livable world.

By these traditional definitions of conservative, many in the Conservative wing are more fairly labeled as free market radicals—willing to risk future stability and damage our environment in exchange for short term financial gain. This approach is not inherently conservative.<sup>8</sup> Political identities in the world may, in fact, be ripe for a massive realignment wherein many traditionally conservative values pair more naturally with the political "left" (liberal wing) than with the "right." In recent decades, the left has been more concerned about environmental issues and ecological damage. It would make sense that the most conservative or low risk—proposals for future paths would emerge from the political left.

An apt analogy is that our society is, metaphorically, barreling toward a cliff. Faced with credible warnings, the low-risk (conservative) approach would be to alter course: get serious about a non-fossil infrastructure and transition away from growth. At the very least, let off the gas pedal: reduce resource use while we learn more. Keeping the foot down on the pedal and seeking to accelerate as fast as possible is probably the least wise<sup>9</sup> decision, yet best characterizes the current approach. 9: This decision would be okay if we *knew*Unfortunately, a common tendency of people on the receiving end of the kind of message this book advances is to get frustrated when the story is *not* tied up neatly into a happy ending. Perhaps our story-telling culture has irreversibly conditioned people to expect resolution at the end of every movie or show. Nature and the world are under no such obligations to satisfy our psychological need for closure, so it is unfair to blame the messenger for accurately conveying the perils and uncertainty of our times. Perhaps people seek a hopeful conclusion so that they can walk away unencumbered—satisfied that everything is under control and that somebody will figure something out. But this tendency is perhaps counter-productive, in that only by internalizing and burdening oneself with the daunting nature of our challenge will it be possible to mount a collective and effective response. If human nature is such that unpalatable stories don't gain traction, it is another way to say that we are not built to overcome a global dilemma of this scale. So push back

#### <span id="page-351-0"></span>**20.2.1 Predicament, not Problems**

It may also be advisable to avoid characterizing the set of interconnected global challenges as "problems," because the word *problem* implies a *solution*. It implicitly isolates the issue at hand into a stand-alone simple issue, promoting "what if we just. . . " proposed solutions. The real story is far more intricate, and more like a game of whack-a-mole.<sup>10</sup> 10: . . . a game where heads pop up out of A simple "fix" to one corner of the problem makes something worse elsewhere. A better word is [predicament,](#page-453-0) intoning a more serious and possibly intractable situation. Perhaps a predicament can be viewed as an *interconnected set of thorny challenges* rather than a collection of isolated problems.

Predicaments don't have solutions, but [responses.](#page-455-0) Piecemeal fixes are unlikely to "solve" the current predicament in a way that permits moving on and relegating the problems to the past.<sup>11</sup> 11: . . . as was the case for curing polio, for But we *can* imagine recrafting our world, *responding* to the challenges by adapting our mode of living to be compatible with planetary limits. Problems can be faced head-on and be defeated, whereas predicaments call for stepping around and finding a different path.

# <span id="page-351-1"></span>**20.3 Personal Adaptation and Guidelines**

Previous chapters have discussed the challenges democratic governments have in imposing any form of reduction that feels like sacrifice to the population. Since political power in democracies starts with individuals, we focus here on what individuals can do to reduce their demand on energy resources. If enough individuals are *not* willing to make such adjustments, it is doubtful that the U.S. government, for instance, would exert authority over this sensitive domain of personal freedom.

This section addresses ways to take personal control of energy expenditures.<sup>12</sup> 12: Energy usage correlates strongly with The presupposition is that the reader is *interested* in ways to reduce their impact, or footprint, on the planet and its resources. Collective progress on this front would reduce the current 18 TW demand on energy, making it that much easier for fossil fuel replacements to satisfy a more modest demand. A voluntary course of reduction on a broad enough scale would reduce vulnerability to forced reduction that would ultimately accompany declining fossil resource availability or climate-motivated reduction targets. It is also good preparation for potential scarcity.

resource usage, in general.

We will first look at attitudes and framing, then some overarching guidelines, followed by specific quantitative assessment of energy expenditures. Readers can identify for themselves areas for potential change in their own habits and expectations.

### <span id="page-352-0"></span>**20.3.1 Overall Framing**

In the absence of a major shift in public attitudes toward energy and resource usage, motivated individuals can control their own footprints via personal decisions. This can be a fraught landscape, as some people may try to out-woke each other and others will resist any notion of giving up freedoms or comforts—only exacerbated by a sense of righteous alienation from the "do-gooders."

Some basic guidelines on effective adaptation:

- 1. Choose actions based on some analysis of impact: don't bother with superficial stuff, even if it's trendy.
- 2. Don't simply follow a list of actions or impart a list on others: choose a more personalized adventure<sup>13</sup> 13: . . . resulting in a mindful pursuit and based on quantitative assessment.
- 3. Avoid showing off. It is almost better to treat personal actions as secrets. Others may simply notice those choices and ask about them, rather than you bringing them up.<sup>14</sup> 14: A joke illustrates the usual pitfall: "How
- 4. Resist the impulse to ask: "what should I *buy* to signal that I'm environmentally responsible?" Consumerism and conspicuous consumption are a large part of the problem. Buying new stuff is perhaps counterproductive and may not be the best path.
- <span id="page-352-1"></span>5. Be flexible. Allow deviations. Rigid adherence makes life more difficult and might inconvenience others, which can be an unwelcome imposition. Such behavior makes your choices less palatable to others, and therefore less likely to be adopted or replicated.
- 6. Somewhat related to the last point, chill out a bit. Every corner of your life does not have to be perfect. We live in a deeply imperfect world, so that exercising a 30% footprint compared to average is pretty darned good, and not *that* much different than a "more perfect" 25%. Doing a few big things means more than doing a lot of little things that may drive you (and others) crazy.
- 7. In the end, it has to matter to *you* what you're doing and why. It's not for the benefit of others.<sup>15</sup>

The first two items on the list are not easy: most people are not themselves equipped to quantitatively evaluate the impact of their choices. But some simple guidelines can help.

### <span id="page-353-0"></span>**20.3.2 Energy Assessment Principles**

This section contains a number of key insights that can guide actions. Each starts with a simple statement in bold font, followed by elaboration and then an example or two<sup>16</sup> for most. [16: A number of the examples require some](#page-16-1)**Heat is costly.** Anything whose job it is to create [thermal energy](#page-456-0) (heat) is a power-hog: clothes dryer; home heating; hot water heater; space heater. A small device called the [Kill-A-Watt](#page-450-0) is handy for assessing power draw by plug-in appliances.

**Example 20.3.1** How much energy does it take to dry a load of clothes using a 5,000 W clothes dryer?

Assuming it takes about an hour to run, this is 5 [kWh,](#page-451-0) or 18 MJ.

**Example 20.3.2** How much energy does it take to heat all the water in a 40 gal (150 L) tank from 10◦C to 50◦C?

Recalling Def. [5.5.1](#page-92-0) (p. [73\)](#page-92-0) or the definition of the [kilocalorie,](#page-450-1) heating 150 L (150 kg) by <sup>Δ</sup>푇 <sup>=</sup> <sup>40</sup>◦<sup>C</sup> will take 6,000 [kcal,](#page-450-2) which converts to 25 MJ or 7 [kWh](#page-451-0) of energy.

**How often is it on?** [Duty cycle](#page-445-0) matters a lot: how often it's on. A microwave oven uses a lot of [power,](#page-453-1) but not so much [energy,](#page-446-0) because it is hardly ever running. The [Kill-A-Watt](#page-450-0) mentioned above accumulates [kWh](#page-451-0) and allows determination of the average power of a device.

**Example 20.3.3** How much energy is a 1,500 W microwave oven at home likely to use in a day, compared to a 25 W television tuner box running 100% of the time?

The microwave might be on for 12 minutes per day, or 0.2 hours. That makes 0.3 kWh<sup>17</sup> for the microwave and 0.6 kWh for the tuner box. 17: . . . 1.5 kW times 0.2 hours Time matters.

**Large**  $\Delta T$  **is costly.** The [power](#page-453-1) it takes to maintain a temperature difference is *proportional to the temperature difference*.<sup>18</sup> For related reasons, a refrigerator in a hot garage has to work especially hard<sup>19</sup> to maintain a large  $\Delta T$ .
  

<sup>18</sup>: See heat loss rate and Sec. 6.3 (p. 86).
  

<sup>19</sup>: . . . and at lower efficiency according to Eq. 6.10 (p. 95)**Example 20.3.4** How much more daily energy does it take to keep a home at 25◦C inside when it is 5◦C outside versus keeping it at 15◦C inside?

In the first case, <sup>Δ</sup>푇 is 20◦C, while it's just 10◦<sup>C</sup> in the second case. So it will take twice as much energy to keep the interior at 25◦C compared to 15◦C.

**Use common units.** Cross-comparison of energy usage is made more difficult by different units. [Table](#page-354-0) [20.1](#page-354-0) provides conversions to [kWh](#page-451-0) as a thought and estimation, which is not typical of assigned problems but may be advantageous here to promote the kind of thinking that is useful when applying to personalized situations.

17: . . . 1.5 kW times 0.2 hours

<sup>18</sup> 18: See [heat loss rate](#page-449-0) and [Sec.](#page-105-0) [6.3](#page-105-0) (p. [86\)](#page-105-0). For related reasons,

Eq. [6.10](#page-114-0) (p. [95\)](#page-114-0)

standard. In terms of [power,](#page-453-1) many appliances are rated in [Btu/](#page-442-0)hr, which is 0.293 W. So a hot water heater at 30,000 Btu/hr is equivalent to about 10 kW and will consume 5 kWh if running for half-an-hour, for instance. Putting everything in the same units [\(kWh](#page-451-0) as a suggestion here) allows useful comparisons of choices.

**Example 20.3.5** In a month, the utility bill for a house shows 600 [kWh,](#page-451-0) 20 [Therms,](#page-456-1) and the two cars of the household used a total of 60 gallons of gasoline. How do these stack up, when assessed in the same units?

Using [Table](#page-354-0) [20.1,](#page-354-0) the gas amounts to 586 kWh—almost identical to electricity—and the gasoline totals about 2,200 kWh, far outweighing the other two.

**Electricity source matters.** Your local source for electricity<sup>20</sup> can impact choices. It should be possible to determine your local mix via online sources [\[126\]](#page-438-0). The fact that conventional power plants tend to convert chemical energy into delivered electricity at 30–40% efficiency needs to be considered in comparing direct use of a fossil fuel against electrical solutions based on fossil fuel. A [heat pump](#page-449-1) design for a water heater can compensate for this loss, and then some.<sup>21</sup>  
20: ... coal vs. natural gas vs. hydroelectric, for example  
[\[126\]](#page-438-0): Nuclear Energy institute (2019), *State Electricity Generation Fuel Shares*  
21: ... if the [COP](#page-444-0) is higher than 2.5, for**Example 20.3.6** A hot water heater using natural gas is likely about 85% efficient at transferring the heat of combustion into the water (enclosed, insulated), while an electric hot water heater manages to get 100% of the delivered energy into the water via a heating coil immersed in the water. If the source of electricity is also natural gas form a power plant achieving 40% efficiency at converting [thermal](#page-456-0) [energy](#page-456-0) into electricity and then transmitting it to the house at 95% efficiency, which method uses more total fossil fuel energy, and by what factor?

We compare 85% efficient for the direct usage to 40% times 95% times 100%.<sup>22</sup> 22: This last one is for the immersed coil, The ratio of 85% to 38% is 2.2, so it will take 2.2 times more gas at the power plant than in the home to produce the same result in heated water.

**Weight is a guide.** A rough rule of thumb is that the energy cost of consumer goods is not too far from the energy contained in the *equivalent weight*<sup>23</sup> *in gasoline*, meaning 13 kWh/kg ([Table 20.1](#page-354-0)). Should you use paper or plastic bags? The one that weighs more probably required greater energy and resource use. Should you drive back home if you forgot your reusable bag? Compare the amount (weight) of gasoline you'll use to the weight of the disposable bags the store uses.<sup>24</sup> High-tech gadgets, like smart phones, almost certainly break this rule and cost far more energy to produce than their gas-equivalent weight—as can be approximated in the next point.

back; can you manage without any bags at all and not risk dropping anything?

**Example 20.3.7** Should you buy a new, more efficient refrigerator that will use 1.8 kWh per day (75 W average) instead of your current one that uses 2.4 kWh/day (100 W average)?

At a mass around 150 kg, the refrigerator's manufacture might require ∼2,000 kWh,<sup>25</sup> taking about 9 years to pay back at the 0.6 kWh/day 25: . . . 150 kg times 13 kWh/kg saving. This is long enough that considerations such as material resources and disposal might tip the scale against replacement.

**Cost is a guide.** A secondary approach to figuring energy content is to suspect that the item's cost is appreciably greater than the cost of the energy that went in. Perhaps a reasonable number is that 15% of the total cost goes toward energy.<sup>26</sup> 26: This is not a capricious estimate, as it Conveniently, a typical retail price of electricity of \$0.15/kWh then translates to 1 kWh for each \$1 of consumer spending. When results from the two approaches (by mass or by price) differ, the higher energy cost number may be the safer bet.

**Example 20.3.8** What do the two methods say about a 1,500 kg car that costs \$25,000 and a smart phone that costs \$1,000 and has 200 g of mass?

The car estimates are 1,500 kg times 13 kWh/kg for about 20,000 kWh or \$25,000 times 1 kWh/\$ for 25,000 kWh. In this case, they're pretty close and it hardly matters which one we favor.

For the phone, the mass estimate is just 2.6 kWh, but by price it would be 1,000 kWh. In this case, for reasons argued above, the larger one is more likely on target.<sup>27</sup> 27: We would not go so far as to say that

**Focus on the big.** Keep your eye on the big impacts. We are not actually under threat of running out of landfill space, for instance. So while recycling is a preferred approach,<sup>28</sup> very visible in society, and should be practiced when possible, the impact is not dramatic: it still takes a lot of energy to process recycled goods. Metal recycling (especially aluminum) is most effective from energy and resource standpoints, and paper from a resource standpoint (trees), but plastic is less clear on both energy and resource bases. Reducing its use may be best.**Example 20.3.9** How effective is it to buy a water bottle for my daily needs?

Compare the weight and cost of the water bottle to the weight and cost of all the plastic cups it displaces<sup>29</sup> 29: Consider the duration of ownership or as a reasonable guide to the relative impact.

The best of all worlds is not buying something for the purpose, but finding something you *already have* that will get the job done.

**Reduction rules.** Reduction is by far the action with the biggest impact. Buy less stuff. Live more simply. Travel less often and less far.<sup>30</sup>

A useful exercise is to compare your own energy footprint to national averages. How much more or less are you using? For some categories, information is hard to assess. For instance, how much oil is used to transport the goods you buy and the food you eat? How much energy is used in the industrial and commercial [sectors](#page-455-1) on your behalf?<sup>32</sup> In part, your level of consumerism is a good clue, but it still may be hard to compare to others. The following items offer some guidance. The first two entries can be derived from Fig. [7.2](#page-124-0) [\(p.105\),](#page-124-0) after unit conversions and dividing by the U.S. population.  
32: Wouldn't it be great if consumer goods had labels revealing embedded energy and resulting CO2?**Electricity**: A typical American uses 12 [kWh](#page-451-0) of electricity per day in their residence. To get your own share, look at an electricity bill for your residence and divide by the number of people living in the place and by the number of days<sup>33</sup> 33: . . . usually a month: about 30 days in the billing period.

**Example 20.3.12** The author's household has two vehicles,<sup>41</sup> one of which drove 400 miles and used 22 gallons of gasoline in 2019, and the other covered 8,660 miles using 69 gallons. What is the daily average use per person in the household, and how does this compare to the national average?A total of 91 gallons for two people is about 45 gallons per person, equivalent to 4.5 kWh/day, and 11% of the national average.

**Air travel**: Expressing an average in this case is inappropriate, as many Americans do not fly at all, while all use some combination of electricity, gas, and gasoline in some capacity. The average works out to 2,300 miles (3,700 km) per year when averaging all people, but among those for whom air travel is a utilized, the number is generally a good bit higher. To put it in context and enable useful comparisons, we will compare it to ground transportation.

Typical passenger jets get approximately 90 miles per gallon (m.p.g.) *per seat*<sup>42</sup> (2.6 L/100 km) for a fully-occupied plane—worse if seats are empty: down to 45 m.p.g. per passenger if half full, for instance. So traveling 1,000 km in a full airplane uses the same amount of fossil fuel energy per person as driving the same 1,000 km in an efficient doubly-occupied car that gets 45 m.p.g. (5.2 L/100 km). For an 80% full airplane,<sup>43</sup> the effective per-passenger mileage is about 70 m.p.g., coming to an energy cost of about **0.5 kWh per mile (0.32 kWh/km) per passenger**. Because air travel tends to involve *long* trips, the energy used (thus CO<sup>2</sup> emissions) for air travel can easily exceed that for personal car usage, as is seen in the next example.

**Example 20.3.13** The author, in 2019, flew about 4,200 miles for personal travel and 9,600 miles work-related. How many [kWh](#page-451-0) per day does this translate to in the two categories, and how does it compare to expenditures in electricity, gas, and personal gasoline?

For personal air travel, 4,200 miles times 0.5 kWh per mile is 2,100 kWh or 5.8 kWh/day, which is slightly larger than the 4.3, 2.4, and 4.5 kWh/ day from electricity, natural gas, and personal gasoline computed in previous examples, but still really in the same ballpark. Business travel<sup>44</sup> accounts for 13 kWh/day, *by itself* exceeding the sum of 44: Ugh. Wish I didn't have to. household expenditures.

**Example 20.3.14** If three people are traveling from San Diego to San Francisco at a distance of 700 km, how good does the car's gas mileage need to be to beat an 80% full airplane that would get 90 miles per gallon per passenger if full?

Being 80% full knocks the effective fuel economy down to 72 m.p.g. per passenger. For the three people in question, a car achieving 24 m.p.g. (9.8 L/100 km) will match the airplane's energy expenditure, so

42: The airplane as a whole gets less than *one* mile per gallon, but each passenger's share of gallons used makes it better on a *per-passenger* basis. It takes almost the same amount of energy to fly a plane from point A to point B independent of passenger load. Most of the energy is used to fight air resistance, which is related to the size and speed of the airplane, essentially independent of the number of passengers inside.

44: Ugh. Wish I didn't have to.

Note that we didn't need the distance. This may seem like a "trick," but consider that life is even trickier: real-world problems have no (or maybe *all available*) information provided, and it's up to us to sort out what's relevant.

anything getting better performance will deliver the three people at a lower energy cost.

**Diet Impacts**: Modern agricultural practices result in a 10:1 energy expenditure on the production, distribution, and waste of food—so that each [kilocalorie](#page-450-1) of food eaten requires 10 [kcal](#page-450-2) of energy input [\[97\]](#page-437-0). A [\[97\]](#page-437-0): Pfeiffer (2006), *Eating Fossil Fuels* typical 2,100 kcal/day diet translates into 2.4 kWh/day, and applying the 10:1 ratio means that about 24 kWh of energy input is required to cover a typical American's diet—which is substantial on the scale of residential/personal energy use. Because food is also grown for livestock and poultry, then those animals convert the food to meat at some low efficiency, raising animals for meat is a net energy drain: directly eating the grown food ourselves<sup>45</sup> 45: . . . preferably in not exactly the same would use less energy and fewer resources.

#### <span id="page-358-0"></span>**20.3.4 Dietary Energy**

This last point on food energy deserves some elaboration, setting the stage for a quantitative evaluation of diet choices. For any food type, it is possible to characterize the amount of energy spent producing the food as a ratio to the metabolic energy contained in the food.<sup>46</sup> Key results of some such studies ([\[127\]](#page-438-1) and [\[128\]](#page-438-2)) are provided in [Table 20.2.](#page-358-1) Treat these as *rough* guides rather than absolutely definitive numbers, since specific agricultural, feeding, or fishing practices play a huge role in the energy requirements: large variations can be expected, in practice. All the same, fruits and vegetables consistently require small energy expenditures relative to meat and dairy products.<span id="page-358-1"></span>

Let's be clear about what [Table](#page-358-1) [20.2](#page-358-1) says. The production of 100 kcal of rice requires an input of 48 kcal, making it a net energy gain. Meanwhile, 100 kcal from beef takes 1,600 kcal of energy to produce, as an energy loser. Lamb and shrimp are very costly, while herring is a steal. It may seem surprising that eggs require more energy input than chicken,<sup>47</sup> 47: Owning egg-laying chickens and feeding them scraps is a delightful win, however. but consider that it takes longer for a chicken to produce its weight in eggs than for a chicken to get large enough to be processed for meat.

In [Table](#page-359-0) [20.3,](#page-359-0) the first column of numbers is a weighted average of factors from [Table](#page-358-1) [20.2,](#page-358-1) using the distribution weights listed where available, and assuming equal spread otherwise. The next column scales the energy ratios so that the vegetable category has <sup>푅</sup><sup>v</sup> <sup>=</sup> 1, making the [dietary energy factor](#page-445-1) a measure of energy requirements *relative to* a strictly plant-based diet. For instance, red meat requires 37 times as much energy as vegetable matter, for the same metabolic energy content.

What follows in the table are four diet types, reflecting the average American diet and three variants, each having its own set of <sup>푓</sup><sup>x</sup> factors.<sup>50</sup> 50: Note: contrived to add to 1 in each case.

**Example 20.3.15** Let's replicate the American diet result in [Table](#page-359-0) [20.3](#page-359-0) using [Eq.](#page-359-1) [20.1.](#page-359-1)Using  $f_v = 0.72$ ,  $f_{rm} = 0.09$ ,  $f_f = 0.01$ ,  $f_p = 0.05$ , and  $f_d = 0.13$ , then  $R_v = 1$ ,  $R_{rm} = 37$ ,  $R_f = 55$ ,  $R_p = 8.5$ , and  $R_d = 8$ , the dietary energy factor computes to  $0.72 + 3.33 + 0.55 + 0.425 + 1.04 = 6.07$ , confirming the final row. By breaking things out this way, the red meat category stands out as contributing more[<sup>51</sup>](#page-14-5) than any other category.
[<sup>51</sup>](#page-14-5): Red meat is 3.33, which is 55% of theCompared to a strictly plant-based (vegan) diet, the typical American diet requires about six times the energy. Since the average American diet accounts for 24 kWh per day, a vegan diet is therefore down to 4 kWh/day. A vegetarian diet partaking of dairy and eggs (lacto-ovo diet) is 2.4 times<sup>52</sup> the vegan diet, or a little less than 40% of the American diet (about 9 kWh/day). Just replacing all meat consumption with chicken (final column) cuts energy demand in half. These are just a few of the countless examples that may be explored using [Eq.](#page-359-1) [20.1](#page-359-1) or variants thereof to evaluate the energy impact of dietary choices.**Table 20.3:** [Dietary energy factor](#page-445-1) computations for various diets. Energy factors are aggregations over categories from [Table](#page-358-1) [20.2,](#page-358-1) assuming equal distributions when unknown (e.g., each fish type is 25% and each plant type is 10% of that category's intake). The net effect, at bottom, is a weighted sum of the individual energy ratios, and spans large factors in terms of energy impact.

total energy cost while providing only 9% of the dietary benefit.

52: The actual number depends on the fraction of calories coming from dairy/eggs (푓d), and can be dialed at will: it's not stuck at exactly 2.4.

Get on it! Evaluate your own diet and how you might modify it.

**Example 20.3.16** What is the [dietary energy factor](#page-445-1) for a diet in which one-third of caloric intake is from red meat, 10% is from dairy/eggs, and the rest is plant matter?

Setting  $f_{rm} = 0.33$  and  $f_d = 0.10$ , we require that  $f_v = 0.57$  in order that all three sum to 1.0. Now using  $R_{rm} = 37$ ,  $R_d = 8$ , and  $R_v = 1$ , the dietary energy factor computes to 12.2+0.8+0.57 = 13.6 for red meat, dairy, and vegetable matter, respectively. This diet requires more than twice the production energy as a standard American diet.It is possible to abandon [Eq.](#page-359-1) [20.1](#page-359-1) and roll your own formulation following similar principles. Rather than adopt the distributions from [Table](#page-358-1) [20.2,](#page-358-1) the technique can be customized to any diet for which energy factors can be found.

**Example 20.3.17** A diet that is 35% rice, 35% wheat, 15% corn, 10% milk, and 5% chicken has an energy cost of  $0.35 \cdot 0.48 + 0.35 \cdot 0.45 + 0.15 \cdot 0.40 + 0.10 \cdot 4.9 + 0.05 \cdot 5.5 = 0.17 + 0.16 + 0.06 + 0.49 + 0.28 = 1.15$ . This has not been normalized to  $R_v = 1$  yet,[<sup>53</sup>](#page-359-0) so we divide by the aggregate 0.65 value for the plant energy ratio found in [Table 20.3](#page-359-0) to get a dietary energy factor 1.8 times that of a strictly plant-based diet. Note from the sum that milk and chicken are the largest two contributors, despite being a small fraction of the diet.The 10:1 input:output energy ratio mentioned at the beginning of this diet segment may at first glance not square with the whole-diet energy factors computed here (e.g., a factor of 6 for the typical American diet). Missing is **food waste**. The U.S. produces 1.8 kcal of food value for every 1 kcal consumed [\[127\]](#page-438-1). This amount of waste may be hard to fathom, but consider waste at restaurants, cafeterias, and grocery stores when perishable items are not consumed before health standards suggest or require disposal. Still, this is an area ripe for improvement. [\[127\]](#page-438-1): Eshel et al. (2006), "Diet, Energy, and Global Warming"#### <span id="page-360-0"></span>**20.3.5 Flexitarianism**

Echoing Point [#5](#page-352-1) in the list in [Section](#page-352-0) [20.3.1,](#page-352-0) it is worth pointing out that energy and resource concerns are a largely *quantitative* game. One need not become a strict vegan to affect energy demands substantively. For instance, eating meat one meal a week,<sup>54</sup> and tending to stick to poultry 54: . . . out of about 40 meals when doing so would drop the energy factor of [Eq.](#page-359-1) [20.1](#page-359-1) to a value so near to 1.0 that the difference is of little consequence.

<span id="page-360-1"></span>**Example 20.3.18** For instance, if one meal per week, or about one in 40 of your meals looks like the last column in [Table](#page-359-0) [20.3—](#page-359-0)72% plant-based and the rest poultry and dairy—what is the [dietary energy](#page-445-1) [factor](#page-445-1) for this diet?

dairy contributions by  $\frac{1}{40}$  and adjust  $f_v$  to bring the total to 1.0. Doing so yields  $f_v = 0.993$ ,  $f_p = 0.00375$ , and  $f_d = 0.00325$ . Multiplying by the respective  $R_x$  values and summing produces 1.05.Thus, the one meal of poultry/dairy per week achieves 99% of the journey from normal-American (6.1) to full vegan (1.0), from an energy perspective.

The result of [Example](#page-360-1) [20.3.18](#page-360-1) is so nearly 1.0 that it is essentially indistinguishable from a purely plant-based diet, quantitatively. This is especially true in the context that the rule-of-thumb factors are themselves not to be taken literally as high-precision numbers. All pork will not have an energy ratio of 27.0. All tuna will not be 17.0. All wheat will not be 0.45. The methods of producing the food—of all types—become important at this stage. Note that gardening (and canning) one's own food is a way to nourish ourselves at a super-low resource burden—undercutting the nominal vegan energy factor even further.

The quantitative focus suggests an approach best called [flexitarianism.](#page-447-1) If energy and resources are the primary concern, rather than ethical issues around eating meat,<sup>55</sup> then the occasional meat treat is no big deal. 55: . . . valid in its own domain Under this scheme, it is still possible to enjoy traditional foods on special occasions like holidays.<sup>56</sup> 56: . . . arguably making them *more* special If a friend serves meat at a dinner party, just do the quick calculation and realize that you can easily offset later<sup>57</sup> 57: . . . or note that you have already offset and make this special-occasion meal disappear into the quantitative noise. The perception you generate is therefore more likely to be as a grateful friend, rather than as a person whose needs are difficult to satisfy.

More people are likely to be attracted to join in responsible behaviors if they are not too rigid or strict. Imagine ordering a bean, rice, and cheese burrito only to take a bite and discover a morsel of meat inside. Score! Meat Treat! It doesn't have to be a bad thing, if resource cost is what matters most. This flexibility can also apply to waste food. Before watching meat get thrown into the trash, intercept with your mouth. From a resource point of view, *wasting* meat—or any food, really—is also something we should strive to avoid: better that the energy investment produce metabolic benefit than be utterly wasted.

Of the things that *are* under our discretion, as discussed in the sections above, [Table](#page-362-1) [20.4](#page-362-1) summarizes the average American values and those of the author in 2019.<sup>[58](#page-362-1)</sup> Recall that the average American air travel corresponds to just 2,300 miles (3,700 km) per year. If adding consumerism to the personally-controlled energy toll, perhaps an average American spends \$10–20,000 per year<sup>[59](#page-362-1)</sup> on “stuff,” which would amount to another 25–50 kWh per day if using the rule-of-thumb 1 kWh/\$ from [Section](#page-353-0) [20.3.2.](#page-353-0)

Mostly, this comes about by a combination of awareness, caring, and tolerance for a simpler life without every possible comfort.

#### **Box 20.2: Out of Our Control**

Many energy expenditures are part of a consensus social contract that individuals cannot easily control. Examples would be lighting and interior temperature control policies for large common spaces like office buildings, campuses, libraries, and airports, for instance. Likewise for street lighting in neighborhoods and along highways. Only by large scale shifts in values would the community potentially prioritize energy and resource costs over financial cost or public health and safety.

## <span id="page-362-0"></span>**20.4 Values Shifts**

In the end, a bold reformulation of the human approach to living on this planet will only succeed if societal values change from where they are now. Imagine if the following activities were frowned upon—found distasteful and against social norms:

1. keeping a house warm enough in winter to wear shorts inside;

self as an upper limit, or another 13 kWh per day in this mode.

60: Recall: 240 kWh per day total.

- 2. keeping a house so cool in summer that people's feet get cold;
- 3. having 5 cars in an oversized garage;
- 4. accumulating enough air miles to be in a special "elite" club;
- 5. taking frequent, long, hot showers;
- 6. using a clothes dryer during a non-rainy period;
- 7. having a constant stream of delivery vehicles arrive at the door;
- 8. a full waste bin each week marking high consumption;
- 9. having a high-energy-demand diet (frequent meat consumption);
- 10. upgrading a serviceable appliance, disposing of the old;
- 11. wasteful lighting.

At present, many of these activities connote success and are part of a culture of "conspicuous consumption." If such things ran counter to the sensibilities of the community, the behaviors would no longer carry social value and would be abandoned. The social norms in some Scandinavian countries praise egalitarianism and find public displays of being "better" or of having more money/stuff to be in poor taste. Abandonment of consumerist norms could possibly work, but only if it stems from a genuine understanding of the negative consequences. If curtailment of resource-heavy activities is imposed by some authority or is otherwise reluctantly adopted, it will not be as likely to transform societal values.

While it may seem objectionable, it is worth recognizing that public shame carries surprising power.<sup>61</sup> A recent experiment in Bolivia put traffic monitors on the streets wearing zebra costumes<sup>62</sup> to combat irresponsible driving habits endangering pedestrians. The zebras would "call out" violators by making a show and pointing to the offenders. That simple action has been effective. Other cultures have required perpetrators of unsavory acts to stand in a public place for a day wearing a sign announcing their transgression, recognizing the power of public shame. It is difficult to imagine similar remedies today, and for many good reasons.<sup>63</sup> 63: . . . e.g., not a very nurturing approach

Yet our society has perhaps gotten too far away from personal ownership of actions. Anonymity in our modern world promotes rude behavior: on roads, on the internet, and in heavily-populated urban areas, where often no one within sight is familiar. If environmentally costly activities were to acquire taboo status, it is pretty certain we would see far less of it, for fear of shame.

# <span id="page-363-0"></span>**20.5 Flexibility as an Answer to Uncertainty**

No one has a crystal ball. No one can credibly say what the future holds. Anyone claiming that we're heading for certain complete collapse should not be trusted. But neither should someone who says everything will be glorious. It is not hard to find either sort of message in this world, yet we cannot discern with confidence which is ultimately correct.

61: The author became aware of this power in the context of student project demonstrations open to the whole department to watch. The prospect of public failure provided supplemental motivation for students to work super-hard—harder than the author typically observed in other courses.

While this text may seem more aligned toward a grim outlook, it is somewhat intentional as a means to raise awareness toward what seems like a minority view—without crossing the line and claiming any certainty on the possible perils ahead.

Another rationale for this book's tone relates to [asymmetric risk](#page-441-0) [\(Figure](#page-364-0) [20.1\)](#page-364-0). If we take potentially catastrophic threats seriously and at least formulate plans to mitigate them, then little harm is done if the threat does not materialize: just "wasted" time and effort being careful.<sup>64</sup> 64: . . . and oh darn—we might end up with But ignoring the threat could mean "game over." Even if the probability of the threat is low, like 10%, it is worthy of attention if the consequences of ignoring it could be devastating. People routinely buy insurance for similar reasons: to mitigate low-probability but potentially debilitating events.

That said, how does a person navigate their own life choices under a cloud of existential uncertainty? One answer is to pick avenues that can be useful in either eventuality. Choosing a route that only makes sense if things hum along as they have done for the past many decades could be risky. So put some thought into directions that are likely to be valued whether or not the human endeavor suffers large setbacks. Be flexible. Mostly, this involves imagining a more difficult future and asking what paths still work in that scenario, while still having a place in today's world.

What skills or functions will likely always be valuable? One approach is to think about what elements of human existence are likely to always be present. We will always need food, shelter, health care, transportation, fabrication capability, resource utilization, wisdom, and entertainment. The exact form ranges from primitive to high-tech. But not every profession supported today has an obvious place on this list. In the face of this, it seems worthwhile to learn the *fundamentals* of any vocation you elect to pursue, so that if deprived of all the technological assistance available today, you can fall back on the basics and still achieve some worthwhile results.

A first step may be to become less reliant on technology for simple tasks. Use brains more and devices less. The practice will lead to greater mental capacity—in any outcome. Do math in your head. Learn and retain<sup>65</sup> 65: . . . internalize; own important facts and concepts, so that Google is not required to form full thoughts.

**Figure 20.1:** Asymmetric risk in the face of a potential devastating threat. Plan A is the natural response if the threat is not believed to be real, and Plan B is appropriate for mitigating the threat. The downside of the threat being real but sticking to Plan A is catastrophic, whereas pursuing Plan B unnecessarily is not ideal, but not nearly as bad. We don't get to choose reality (column), but we do get to chose the plan (row). Are we feeling lucky, or conservative?

65: ...internalize; own

Try modes of living that are less cushy than normal, even if temporarily. A week-long backpacking trip is a great way to feel like a part of nature, and come to understand that some level of discomfort or hardship is tolerable—or even confidence-building.<sup>66</sup> 66: Ideally, start small on a one- or two-The first few days may be a difficult adjustment, but it is surprising how well and how quickly adaptation can happen—given time, decent weather, and a constructive attitude. After doing this a few times, minor inconveniences or discomforts that arise might be met with far greater grace. The person who remains stable in the face of adversity will be more resilient than many of their peers, and can help others hold things together in crisis.

Keep in mind that humans evolved outdoors, dealt with seasons, and often went many days without food. When did we become so fragile that we need to live within a narrow temperature range to be comfortable, and lose our heads if we don't get three square meals a day? What would our ancestors think of us? By learning to toughen up, the future whatever way it goes—will have less power over us. We can strive to be less vulnerable and at the mercy of events beyond our control. We will have some agency to cope and help others cope with any variety of outcomes. Just by having some confidence in our ability to deal with a bit of adversity or discomfort will allow us to keep cooler heads and be able to recognize important opportunities if and when they come along, rather then being paralyzed by distress.

Hopefully, such preparedness will never be truly needed. And how bad would it be if we "built some character" along the way for no reason.

### <span id="page-365-0"></span>**20.6 Upshot on Strategies**

No one can know what fate awaits us, or control the timing of whatever unfolds. But individuals *can* take matters into their own hands and adopt practices that are more likely to be compatible with a future defined by reduced resource availability. We can learn to communicate future concerns constructively, without being required to paint an artificial picture of hope.<sup>67</sup> 67: The hope lies in how we *react* to the Our actions and choices, even if not showcased, can serve as inspiration for others—or at least can be personally rewarding as an impactful adventure. Quantitative assessment of energy and resource demands empowers individuals to make personal choices carrying large impacts. Reductions of factors of 2 and 3 and 4 are not out of reach. Maybe the world does not *need* 18 TW to be happy. Maybe we don't *have* to work so hard to maintain a peaceful and rewarding lifestyle once growth is not the driver. Maybe we can re-learn how to adapt to the seasons and be fulfilled by a more intimate connection with nature. The value of psychological preparedness should not underestimated. By staring unblinking into the abyss, we are ready to cope with disruption, should it come. And if it never does in our lifetimes, what loss do we

really suffer if we have chosen our adventure and lived our personal values?

In this sense, the best adaptation comes in the form of a mental shift. Letting go of humanity's self-image as a growth juggernaut, and finding an “off-ramp” to a more rewarding lifestyle in close partnership with nature is the main goal. The guidelines provided in this chapter for quantifying and reducing resource demands then simply become the initial outward expressions of this fresh vision. Ignore the potentially counterproductive allure of fusion, teleportation, and warp drive. Embrace instead a humbler, slower, more feasible future that stresses natural harmony over conquest and celebrates life in all forms—while preserving and advancing the knowledge and understanding of the universe we have worked so hard to achieve. Picture a future citizen of this happier world looking back at the present age as embarrassingly misguided and inexplicably delusional. Earth is a partner, not a possession to be exploited. Figuratively throwing Earth under the bus precludes our own chances for long-term success. A common phrasing<sup>[68](#page-68-0)</sup> of this sentiment is that humans are *a part* of nature, not apart from nature. Let's not lose the path in a flight of fossil-fueled fantasy.

Continuing the freeway metaphor, the cur-rent path has us hurtling forward to certain involuntary termination of growth (a dead end, or cliff, or brick wall), very probably resulting in overshoot and/or crash.

Note that, unlike a car, the body does not function just as well at 25% "full" as it does when it is 100% full. Thus the analogy is very flawed. Yet, in primitive times, it was surely routine to dip well below hunger levels not often tolerated today.
